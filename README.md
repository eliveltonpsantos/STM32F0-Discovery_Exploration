# STM32F0-Discovery_Exploration
All schematic and code made by myself to learn to use STM32F0-Discovery.

## Accessing Memory
This project is my first tentative to program STM32F0-Discovery using CubeMX and Eclipse with board Tiny RTC I2C Modules.

The main objective was to learn to create a function in another file, e.g., a library.

I have made a library to write and read and string into EEPROM Memory 24C32 and turn on a LED if the compare is right.


## Accessing RTC DS1307
This project uses an STM32F0-Discovery using CubeMX and Eclipse with board Tiny RTC I2C Modules.

The main objective was to reinforce the learning of I2C Protocol studied in Accessing Memory.

It isn't completed because the main objective has done, in other words, read and write commands of RTC DS1307 are made with successful.
