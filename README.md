# STM32F0-Discovery_Exploration
All schematic and code made by myself to learn to use STM32F0-Discovery.

## Accessing Memory
This project is my first tentative to program STM32F0-Discovery using CubeMX and Eclipse with board Tiny RTC I2C Modules.

The main objective was to learn to create a function in another file, e.g., a library.

I have made a library to write and read and string into EEPROM Memory 24C32 and turn on a LED if the compare is right.
